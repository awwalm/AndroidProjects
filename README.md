# Android Projects

A repository chronicling the first set of Android projects I developed (since 2019) while learning a wide range of techniques required to put together a standard mobile application.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you may run the programs using **Android Studio** along with an emulator (AVD) or an actual device for testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

- **Java 8**: At the moment of writing, the source code was written with Java 8. Should you wish to use a higher/up-to-date version, be sure to account for compatibility makeshifts.
- **A.S. 3.5**: Be wary of compatibility issues for a new version of Android Studio.
- **Gradle**: Model - 3.5.3; Build - 5.4.1.
- **Firebase**: Auth:19.3.0 /Core: 17.2.3/Database: 19.2.1/UI: 6.2.0.
- **Google Play Services**: 4.3.3
- **API Level 23** (modified when needed).
- **SDK Version 23** (modified when needed).
